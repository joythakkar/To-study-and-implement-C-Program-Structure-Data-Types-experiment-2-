# experiment-2
AIM: 

    To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

SOFTWARE USED:

    VS Code

THEORY: 

    In C++, understanding the program structure and data types is essential for writing clear, efficient, and organized code.

Basic Structure of a C++ Program:

     A simple C++ program typically includes the following components:

   Preprocessor Directives:

     Lines starting with #, like #include <iostream>, which import libraries.

Main Function:
        
        The entry point of the program.

    cpp
    Copy
    Edit
    int main() {
    // code
    return 0;
    }
Statements and Expressions:

    Instructions inside the main function that perform tasks.

Comments:

     Used to make the code more readable.
    Single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) comments.

Data Types in C++:
Data types define the type of data a variable can hold. They are categorized as:

Basic/Primitive Data Types:

    1.int – Integer values (e.g., 5, -10)
    2.float – Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14)
    3.double – Double-precision floating-point numbers
    4.char – Single characters (e.g., 'A')
    5.bool – Boolean values (true or false)
    6.void – Represents no value (used in functions)

Derived Data Types:

    Arrays, Functions, Pointers, References

User-defined Data Types:

    struct, union, enum, class

Type Modifiers:

    signed, unsigned, long, short — to alter the size or sign of basic types.

Sample output:

    

CONCLUSION:
In this experiment, we successfully studied the fundamental structure of a C++ program and implemented various built-in data types. We understood how to declare and use variables of different types such as int, float, char, bool, and more. Mastery of program structure and data types forms the foundation for developing all kinds of C++ programs and is essential for writing correct, readable, and efficient code.Understanding the structure and data types is crucial to building programs that are logically correct, memory-efficient, and easy to maintain.
